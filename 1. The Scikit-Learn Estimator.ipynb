    "The major objective of this tutorial is to teach the latest and most robust workflows for those that use pandas for data exploration and scikit-learn for machine learning. The primary focus will be on the new features added to version 0.20 of scikit-learn in September, 2018. [See the changelog here][1] for a list of all the new features.\n",

    "* Learn from data\n",

    "### Finding estimators in the scikit-learn API\n",
    "The scikit-learn package is divided neatly into about 35 modules. Most modules contain several estimators. It can be valuable to take a look at the entire scikit-learn API to help learn which module an estimator is located in. Note that the estimators (CamelCase) are listed first in the modules followed by the helper functions. We display the API in the notebook below.\n",
